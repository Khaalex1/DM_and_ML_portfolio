This would have enabled us to explore how each feature affects the arithmetic performance of subject, make predictions on arithmetic performance such as age or gender. However working with this dataset would have required some Computational neuroscience domain knowledge and expertise in image processing and this might not be the best use of the limited time we have for this coursework. We want something that is challenging but not so challenging that we would not be able to achieve anything within a short period of time.\n",
