# F21DL Portfolio / Brain tumors MRIs dataset 
By Y. SCHLOSSER, T. ADELEKE, A. KHA, S. SHAH, A. HARIS


This repo contains a portfolio made for the course of Data-Mining (F21DL), delivered by Mrs Komendatskaya at Heriot-Watt University. Different classical Machine Learning techniques were employed to classify brain tumors from an MRI dataset. Neural networks are investigated in the last 2 labs. W present in this README a short summary of the 10 labs.

## Lab 1 : Dataset choice

The first lab was dedicated to discuss and choose a dataset to investigate during the following weeks.
3 medical datasets were studied, but the one which apeared as the more convincing was the __Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)__ dataset, available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri. This dataset can be used for real life applications, and appears to be challenging by the variety of images contained in it.

## Lab 2 : Some statistics about the dataset

## Lab 3 : Feature extraction

## Lab 4 : Evaluation Metrics

## Lab 5 : Bayesian Networks

## Lab 7 : Clustering

## Lab 8 : Decision trees

## Lab 9 : Linear and Logistic Regression

## Lab 10 : Multi-Layer Perceptron

## Lab 11 : Convolutional Networks
